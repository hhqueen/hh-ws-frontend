                Who is HHQueen?
                Hi! My name is Payal (sounds like “pile”).
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                My career has been centered around building meaningful and useful customer-focused products & services. That bled into my personal life as I was always conjuring up potential solutions on how to fix the most basic challenges of life.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Especially Happy Hour (aka HH).
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I found myself being the go-to person to answer the question, “where should we go for HH? It’s 5 o’clock!” I found that I had to do a lot of digging to get all the info — hours, food specials, patios, dog policy, etc. Search results would show outdated HH menus. Businesses didn’t have this info on their websites nor their social media. And I didn’t have time to follow hundreds of restaurants in each city (much less, neighborhood) I went to — I wanted one place that had all the info I needed to make a decision, as quickly as possible.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I spent countless hours tracking all this info in an excel file. All the while, I thought, there has to be a better way to manage all this data…right?! I looked and looked, and all the options I found still had many of the problems I already mentioned. There were new options on Instagram & TikTok but it didn’t solve the overall problem — one place that answers any & all my questions.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                So after pent up frustration, one day on a flight to Portland with my phone in airplane mode (aka no distractions!), I took out my business plan template and filled it out with my vision of the perfect HH finder tool.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <span
                    className='italic'
                >*I think you’re getting to know my personality real well by now :) </span>
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Enter me & my website, HHQueen.com: the premier site that gathers all the latest HH data enabling YOU to make quicker decisions to enjoy more hours of happiness while helping businesses drive revenue by attracting new patrons and filling empty seats during typically slower times. Sounds like a win-win situation to me!
